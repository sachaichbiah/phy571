We invite you to read the report to discover which algorithms has been useful for what. In our folder codes, we have put all the algorithms done to compute datas and to represent them. Also, for the simulations that needed much time, we have put the datas computed as numpy .npy files or excel spreadsheets to let you analize the datas by yourselves if you want to.
